Root pool recovery procedure
----------------------------

Root pool recovery procedure, in case of full system disk crash, requires much more SA attention and must be do manually.

When replacing damaged system disk you must execute some required steps. Also, if you have remote backup or archive of root
pool, you can recover destroyed system disk in reasonable short time.

First of all, you need backup root pool to restore them - compressed or uncompressed archive or saved remote file system
on backup server.

Recovery procedure steps completely described below.

1. You need to boot up crached system from external media - DVD,CD, USB or network:

ok boot cdrom

or

ok boot net

2. You need to configure remote access for R-utilities on backup server, which is contains backup (archive or received
filesystem), and start network services:

backup_server# netservices open
backup_server# vi /.rhosts
backup_server# vi /etc/hosts_equiv

If backup server running IPF, you need to grant access from recovering machine.

3. When system disc is physically damaged and you want to replace it, you need to relabel new disk and make slices on it. Disk
label type must be SMI.

4. You need recreate root pool on recovering machine, for example:

# zpool create -f -o failmode=continue -R /a -m legacy rpool c0t0d0s0

5. You need to install boot blocks on new disk:

# installboot -F zfs /usr/platform/`uname -i`/lib/fs/zfs/bootblk  /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0

or

# installgrub /boot/grub/stage1 /boot/grub/stage2 /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0

6. The next step is recursive snapshot receiving and pool recovery from remote backup server:

# rsh backup_server zfs send backup_data/rpool|zfs receive -Fdv rpool

or from compressed archive on remote backup server:

# rsh backup_server gzip -c -d pegasus.rpool.0.zfs.gz|zfs receive -Fdv rpool

You can also recover root pool directly from local archive copy, contains on local mounted USB-drive, for example (unarchived
stream only, for compressed archive you must decompress it first following GZip often unavailable in single user mode when
bootinog from distribution media):

# cd /usbmount
# cat pegasus.rpool.0.zfs|zfs receive -dFv rpool

This step can take some time.

7. Be sure that root pool was successfully restored from backup with zfs list command.

8. You need to set bootfs property for root pool to correct (original) value:

# zpool set bootfs=rpool/ROOT/s10x_u8wos_08a rpool

Dump and swap device recreation is non required when root pool backup snapshot was recirsive or was done with zfsbackup.
Recursive snapshot contains dump and swap devices and they will be recreated during recovery automatically.

9. Finally reboot recovered system:

# init 6

Note: Instead of pool recreation and recovery you can use (starting from 10/09) zflash functionality and recover root pool with
JumpStart flash install from uncompressed stream (archive) created by zfsbackup.
